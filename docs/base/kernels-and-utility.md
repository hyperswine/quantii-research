# Kernels

Kernels are a key part of a useful computing system. There have been many kernels implemented as a part of a greater system, e.g. an operating system. Such kernels include linux, bsd, nt, sun, dos kernel, etc. These kernels have been developed into their modern counterparts and widely used in GNU/Linux, Android (Google/Linux), Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, and other smaller embedded systems. Some systems like the Pi may also have a small RTOS based on something like RODOS or ThreadX.

Newer kernels of interest include a myriad of RTOS's, fushcia (google), sel4, kataos (google), custom console kernels.

## Utility

Kernels are built to be useful.
