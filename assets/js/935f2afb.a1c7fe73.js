There have been many kernels implemented as a part of a greater system, e.g. an operating system. Such kernels include linux, bsd, nt, sun, dos kernel, etc. These kernels have been developed into their modern counterparts and widely used in GNU/Linux, Android (Google/Linux), Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, and other smaller embedded systems. Some systems like the Pi may also have a small RTOS based on something like RODOS or ThreadX.","sidebar":"main"},"base/latency-sensitive-design":{"id":"base/latency-sensitive-design","title":"Latency Sensitive Design","description":"By Jasen Qin.","sidebar":"main"}}}')}}]);
